# Kingdomino
## Presentation
### The tabletop game
Kingdomino is a strategic free-for-all battle for territory management, where players compete with each other to build the wealthiest kingdom.
As the game editor describes it:

```
In Kingdomino, the more connected plots of the same landscape you have, the more points you gain.
But be careful: if you don’t have the related buildings you won’t score any point!
Build your kingdom and try to have the most glorious one!
```

Recommended age: 8+  
Player range: 2 to 4.  
Average game duration: 15 mins.

### This software
As an android enthusiast, tabletop game lover, and software engineer, I want to port all my games in my pocket.  
I already ported Kingdomino once as a university project, but as I was not 100% satisfied with the end result, I decided to take another go at it - by myself this time - using different technologies, and hopefully better software development knowledge.

## Upcoming features
This project is still in progress, the list is too long.
